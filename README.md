# 07 - Tailwind

Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

Using Tailwind requires that a bit more thought goes into your HTML as the CSS will be coupled with the HTML, thus sacrificing a small amount of readability for major improvements in DX(Developer Experience) and Prototyping speed. One way to proactively manage this is to draw boxes around your Components and Subcomponents in the design. This creates a mental and visual model of your HTML tree before implementing a single line of code, and thus making Tailwind a piece of :cake: to use.
